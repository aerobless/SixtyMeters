[The Expanse](http://www.syfy.com/theexpanse){:target="_blank"} is a gritty, realistic and has a high production value! This is the Sci-Fi series I've been waiting for.
It plays about two hundred years in the future (I'd say near future), in a partly colonized solar system. Meaning there's 
people on earth, Mars and on various space station in the asteroid belt. 

Just like in Game of Thrones there's a large set of main characters in different places and you get to experience the overall
story from multiple viewpoints. There's also beautiful cinematography with gorgeous panning shots, huge vistas and competent
use of CGI. But not only the visuals are impressive, the audio design and soundtrack are also top notch. I really hope that they'll 
release the music on Google Play once the season is over. It's also nice that there's no blatant disregard for physics. For example there's 
no "magical" artificial gravity device in the spaceships, instead they use thrust from the engine. So if the ships stops moving forward the gravity stops as well.

So far four episodes have been released and already the series has an [IMDB rating of 8.3](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/){:target="_blank"}. 
And the latest episode "CQB" even achieved a rating of 9.3. Which is really quite impressive.

#### Setting & Story

I don't want to go too deep into the story to avoid spoilers. The general idea is that the humans who left earth and are now 
inhabiting Mars and the astroid belt no longer think of themselves as earth-bound. People who were born in the Asteroid belt, also known as "Belters", 
aren't even capable of living on earth anymore since their bones are strong enough due to the lower gravity. There's a sense of
nationalism and everyone is looking for themselves first. So we can sort of draw a parallel to the kingdoms of Westeros. Between 
Mars and Earth there is sort of a cold war going. The Asteroid belt technically belongs to Earth but the people living there will
never see Earth themselves and dislike being dependant on Earth for basic supplies such as water rations. The situation is quite volatile.
And what ends up happening is that a space freighter, supplying water to the Belters, is attacked and we don't know who it was...

If you have some spare time then give this show a try! It's seriously good! I know SyFy isn't HBO.. but with this show they've really outdone themselves!
