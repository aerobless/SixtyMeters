I never really kept a bookmarks list, instead I relied mostly on my ability to
find anything important on Google. But about 1-2 months ago I came to reevaluate that behaviour, mostly because of these rare edge cases where it took me
a long time to find something I knew I had found once. So I looked for a good chrome extension or service to keep bookmarks.

However I didn't find anything that really suited my needs. So I cleaned out the good old default chrome bookmarks manager, there
were some really old sites in there, and started bookmarking away. Now the default chrome bookmarks manager isn't bad. It looks a bit dated but on the
plus side it's tightly integrated into chrome and syncs automatically with my other Google settings. The only downside it has is that there's not way
to publish bookmarks or somehow share them socially. So in order to fill that void I'm starting to post my bookmarks list, along with short
comments, on my blog every so often.

So without further ado, here are my bookmarks for June 2017:

+ **Bookmarks Bar**
    + **Development**
        + **Java**
            + [JPA Annotations](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/OneToMany) I recently had to implement a One to Many relationship, that's why
            the link points there, but all the other relationships are also documented in this wikibook.
            + **Spring**
                + [Exception Handling/Mapping to HTTP Code](https://spring.io/blog/2013/11/01/exception-handling-in-spring-mvc)

                  Sometimes I accidentally turn this on.. :(

                I needed access from my host system to the web application deployed on my ubuntu development VM so I could fix a bug that only appeared in IE11.. Fuck IE.
            + **Wordpress**
                + [Munsa Lite Theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/munsa-lite/) A nice minimalist theme that I might use if I wanted to setup a WordPress blog. I saw it in action on sdkboy.com.
            + **Daydream**
                + [Building a daydream controller based app from scratch](http://www.sdkboy.com/2016/12/building-daydream-controller-based-app-scratch/) Good tutorial to get started with Google Daydream.
            + **Angular**

                I used this (the CSS part anyway) for my quiz app in the Zühlke JSO Camp 2016.
            + [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/spec.jsp) A free dynamic DNS service hosted on Amazon. Perfect if you want a simple way to expose a small app that's running at home behind a NAT.
            I used this to expose a small nodeJS app that allows me to trigger my Google Home via Chromcast to say things.

    + **Music**
        + [Energy Zürich](https://energy.ch/play/zuerich) Internet radio player for the best commercial radio channel in Switzerland.
        + [Technobase.fm](https://www.technobase.fm/) German Internet radio for electronic music. I usually listen to this when I need some motivation,
        for some reason techno music is just happy and motivational.
        + [Google Music](https://play.google.com/music/listen) Where I keep all my music. Basically like Spotify but better.
    + **Military**
        + [How to tie a necktie](http://www.krawattenknoten.org/images/krawattenknoten-four-in-hand.gif) Yep. Once a year I have to learn how to tie ties so I can get home from military..
        + [SE-240 radio equipment guide](http://www.ticino.evu.ch/Reglement-SE-240-d.pdf)
    + **Motivational**
        + [YouTube: 7 Ways to Maximize Misery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1mTELoj6o&feature=youtu.be)
    + **Odds and ends that were in the bookmarks bar:**
        + [Reddit /r/Place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/#x=405&y=505) Actually I have to get rid of this. /r/place was a reddit 
        experiment which started on the 1st of April and has ended by now. In the experiment every Redditor could place one pixel per 5min and thereby paint a picture
        with thousands of other Reddit users. I mostly helped /r/Switzerland to keep a picture of the swiss flag and some cheese intact.
        + [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) Site where you can get free hight quality photos under the Creative Commons Zero license. I neither used nor posted a photo from there so far.
        + [Olivermak.es](https://olivermak.es/) Beautiful site that's made with Jekyll. I wish mine looked as nice and unique as this. This dude rocks! Also I might steal some tricks from his GitHub at some point.
        + [NASA EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera)](https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov) Recent images of earth from space.
