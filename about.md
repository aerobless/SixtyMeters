Hey! I'm Theo and I work as software engineer at [Zühlke](http://www.zuehlke.com/ch/en/){:target="_blank"} in [Switzerland](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Switzerland){:target="_blank"}.

Some of my hobbies are programming, travelling, [photography]({{ site.url }}/photography/), cycling and skiing. My tools of choice are OS X,
Canon, GitHub and everything from Google. I believe in open source and I've made most of my projects freely available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/aerobless){:target="_blank"}. Yes, you can find the repository of this site on GitHub as well.
